  abstract     = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space
    in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form
    of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued
    that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult
    because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich
    enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A
    variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and
    interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions
    in the simplex are provided as models within which the
    independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of
    parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical
    methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

    we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for

    profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and
    activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in
    applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes
    and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an
    additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3
    unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common

    to a depth of billions or trillions of bases can uncover hundreds

    terabytes of RAM. We present latent strain analysis (LSA), a
    scalable, de novo pre-assembly method that separates reads into
    biologically informed partitions and thereby enables assembly of
    individual genomes. LSA is implemented with a streaming
    calculation of unobserved variables that we call eigengenomes.
    Eigengenomes reflect covariance in the abundance of short,
    fixed-length sequences, or k-mers. As the abundance of each genome
    in a sample is reflected in the abundance of each k-mer in that
    genome, eigengenome analysis can be used to partition reads from
    different genomes. This partitioning can be done in fixed memory
    using tens of gigabytes of RAM, which makes assembly and
    downstream analyses of terabytes of data feasible on commodity
    hardware. Using LSA, we assemble partial and near-complete genomes
    of bacterial taxa present at relative abundances as low as
    0.00001\%. We also show that LSA is sensitive enough to separate
    reads from several strains of the same species.},

  abstract     = {Population genomics of prokaryotes has been studied
    in depth in only a small number of primarily pathogenic bacteria,
    as genome sequences of isolates of diverse origin are lacking for
    most species. Here, we conducted a large-scale survey of
    population structure in prevalent human gut microbial species,
    sampled from their natural environment, with a culture-independent
    metagenomic approach. We examined the variation landscape of 71
    species in 2,144 human fecal metagenomes and found that in 44 of
    these, accounting for 72\% of the total assigned microbial
    abundance, single-nucleotide variation clearly indicates the
    existence of sub-populations (here termed subspecies). A single
    subspecies (per species) usually dominates within each host, as
    expected from ecological theory. At the global scale, geographic
    distributions of subspecies differ between phyla, with Firmicutes
    subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To
    investigate the functional significance of the delineated
    subspecies, we identified genes that consistently distinguish them
    in a manner that is independent of reference genomes. We further
    associated these subspecies-specific genes with properties of the
    microbial community and the host. For example, two of the three
    Eubacterium rectale subspecies consistently harbor an accessory
    pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower
    gut community diversity, higher host BMI, and higher blood fasting
    insulin levels. Using an additional 676 human oral samples, we
    further demonstrate the existence of niche specialized subspecies
    in the different parts of the oral cavity. Taken together, we
    provide evidence for subspecies in the majority of abundant gut
    prokaryotes, leading to a better functional and ecological
    understanding of the human gut microbiome in conjunction with its
    host.},

  abstract     = {Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of
    ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics
    have been extensively studied, much less is known about how
    species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here, we introduce a
    model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within
    and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this
    approach to study evolution in approximately 40 prevalent species
    in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity
    are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection
    on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that
    challenge standard population genetic models of these processes.
    Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate
    over 6-month timescales are only rarely attributable to
    replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident
    strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative
    evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains
    or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these
    mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find
    evidence that some sweeps may be seeded by recombination, in
    addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins
    suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over
    multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the
    extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut
    bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they
    highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary
    dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.},

    Gnotobiotic mouse experiments revealed that increased protein

    might inactivate digoxin through substrate promiscuity. We discuss
    digoxin signaling in eukaryotic systems, and consider the
    possibility that endogenous digoxin-like molecules may have
    selected for microbial digoxin inactivation. Finally, we highlight
    the diverse contributions of gut microbes to drug metabolism,
    present a generalized approach to studying microbe-drug

    differences calculated from comparisons between n haploid genomes
    has frequently been used as a starting point for testing the
    hypothesis of linkage equilibrium. For this purpose the variance
    of the pairwise differences, VD, is used as a test statistic to
    evaluate the null hypothesis that all loci are in linkage
    equilibrium. The problem is to determine the critical value of the
    distribution of VD. This critical value can be estimated either by
    Monte Carlo simulation or by assuming that VD is distributed
    normally and calculating a one-tailed 95\% critical value for VD,
    L, L = E(VD) + 1.645 Var(VD), where E(VD) is the expectation of

    highly diverse data. This has implications for hypothesis testing
    in bacterial populations, which are often genetically highly
    diverse. For this reason we derive a new, exact formula for
    Var(VD). The distribution of VD is examined and shown to approach
    normality as the sample size increases. This makes the new formula
    a useful tool in the investigation of large data sets, where
    testing for linkage using Monte Carlo simulation can be very time
    consuming. Application of the new formula, in conjunction with
    Monte Carlo simulation, to populations of Bradyrhizobium
    japonicum, Rhizobium leguminosarum, and Bacillus subtilis reveals
    linkage disequilibrium where linkage equilibrium has previously

    four longitudinal stool samples collected from an HCT patient
    before and after heavy antibiotic exposure to elucidate the
    genomic underpinnings of microbiome dynamics under extreme
    selective pressures. Low intestinal microbial diversity, often
    leading to domination of the intestine by a single organism, is
    associated with poor outcomes following hematopoietic cell
    transplantation (HCT). Understanding how certain organisms achieve
    domination in the intestine is limited by current metagenomic
    sequencing technologies, which are typically unable to reconstruct
    complete genome drafts without bacterial isolation and culture.
    Recently, we developed a metagenomic read cloud sequencing
    approach that provides significantly improved genome drafts for
    individual organisms compared to conventional short-read
    sequencing methods. Here, we apply read cloud sequencing to four
    longitudinal stool samples collected from an HCT patient before
    and after heavy antibiotic exposure. During this time period, the
    patient experienced Escherichia coli gut domination and an E. coli
    bloodstream infection. We find that read clouds enable the
    placement of multiple copies of antibiotic resistance genes both
    within and across genomes, and the presence of resistance genes
    correlates with the timing of antibiotics administered to the
    patient. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that the E. coli
    bloodstream infection likely originated from the gut. The
    pre-transplant E. coli genome harbors 46 known resistance genes,
    whereas all other organisms from the pre-transplant time point
    contain 5 or fewer resistance genes, supporting a model in which
    the E. coli outgrowth was a result of selection by heavy
    antibiotic exposure. This case study highlights the application of
    metagenomic read cloud sequencing in a clinical context to
    elucidate the genomic underpinnings of microbiome dynamics under

    assembly strategies, Architect does not require a costly
    subassembly step; instead it assembles genomes directly from the
    SLR's underlying short reads, which we refer to as read clouds .
    This enables a 4- to 20-fold reduction in sequencing requirements
    and a 5-fold increase in assembly contiguity on both genomic and
    metagenomic datasets relative to state-of-the-art assembly
    strategies aimed directly at fully subassembled long reads.

    we developed BHap, a novel algorithm based on fuzzy flow networks,

    showed that BHap was capable of reconstructing haplotypes of
    bacterial populations with an average F1 score of 0.87, an average
    precision of 0.87 and an average recall of 0.88. We also
    demonstrated that BHap had a low susceptibility to sequencing
    errors, was capable of reconstructing haplotypes with low coverage
    and could handle a wide range of mutation rates. Compared with
    existing approaches, BHap outperformed them in terms of higher F1

    responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management.
    However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult,
    particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an
    outbreak strain. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of
    metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from
    microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical
    discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing
    bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture.
    DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation,
    45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from
    patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic
    Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected
    to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by
    a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de
    novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of
    the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the
    outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3,
    sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known
    bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain.
    MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data
    for the purposes of identification and characterization of the
    outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS:
    During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was
    obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered
    from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26
    samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the
    Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples
    (67\%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile,
    Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella
    enterica were recovered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results
    suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent
    approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an
    outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving
    diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and
    reducing costs.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT The assessment of microbial diversity and
    distribution is a major concern in environmental microbiology.
    There are two general approaches for measuring community
    diversity: quantitative measures, which use the abundance of each
    taxon, and qualitative measures, which use only the
    presence/absence of data. Quantitative measures are ideally suited
    to revealing community differences that are due to changes in
    relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa
    flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant).
    Qualitative measures are most informative when communities differ
    primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures),
    in part because abundance information can obscure significant
    patterns of variation in which taxa are present. We illustrate
    these principles using two 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial
    populations and two phylogenetic measures of community {$\beta$}
    diversity: unweighted UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted
    UniFrac, a new quantitative measure, which we have added to the
    UniFrac website ( http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac ). These studies
    considered the relative influences of mineral chemistry,
    temperature, and geography on microbial community composition in
    acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and the
    influences of obesity and kinship on microbial community
    composition in the mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative
    and quantitative measures to the same data set can lead to
    dramatically different conclusions about the main factors that
    structure microbial diversity and can provide insight into the
    nature of community differences. We also demonstrate that both
    weighted and unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the
    methods used to build the underlying phylogeny.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The diets of industrialized countries
    reflect the increasing use of processed foods, often with the
    introduction of novel food additives. Xanthan gum is a complex
    polysaccharide with unique rheological properties that have
    established its use as a widespread stabilizer and thickening
    agent1. However, little is known about its direct interaction with
    the gut microbiota, which plays a central role in digestion of
    other, chemically-distinct dietary fiber polysaccharides. Here, we
    show that the ability to digest xanthan gum is surprisingly common
    in industrialized human gut microbiomes and appears to be
    contingent on the activity of a single bacterium that is a member
    of an uncultured bacterial genus in the family Ruminococcaceae. We
    used a combination of enrichment culture, multi-omics, and
    recombinant enzyme studies to identify and characterize a complete
    pathway in this uncultured bacterium for the degradation of
    xanthan gum. Our data reveal that this keystone degrader cleaves
    the xanthan gum backbone with a novel glycoside hydrolase family 5
    (GH5) enzyme before processing the released oligosaccharides using
    additional enzymes. Surprisingly, some individuals harbor a
    Bacteroides species that is capable of consuming oligosaccharide
    products generated by the keystone Ruminococcaceae or a purified
    form of the GH5 enzyme. This Bacteroides symbiont is equipped with
    its own distinct enzymatic pathway to cross-feed on xanthan gum
    breakdown products, which still harbor the native linkage
    complexity in xanthan gum, but it cannot directly degrade the high
    molecular weight polymer. Thus, the introduction of a common food
    additive into the human diet in the past 50 years has promoted the
    establishment of a food chain involving at least two members of
    different phyla of gut bacteria.},

    simplex that define a vector-space structure. Perturbation and
    powering in the simplex play the same role as the sum and product
    by scalars in real space. A standard Dirichlet random composition
    can be shifted by perturbation, and scaled powering by a real
    scalar. The obtained random composition has a shifted-scaled
    Dirichlet distribution. The procedure is analogous to
    standardization of real random variables. The derived distribution
    is a generalization of the Dirichlet one, and it is studied from a
    probabilistic point of view. In the simplex, considered as an
    Euclidean space, the Aitchison measure is the natural (Lebesgue
    type) measure, which is compatible with its operations and
    metrics. Therefore, a natural way of describing the generalized
    (shifted-scaled) Dirichlet probability distributions is using
    probability densities with respect to the Aitchison measure. This
    density representation is compared with the traditional
    probability density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. In
    particular, the center and variability for both representations

    Analysis System (MIDAS), which is an integrated computational
    pipeline for quantifying bacterial species abundance and

    single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from shotgun metagenomes.
    Our method leverages a database of more than 30,000 bacterial
    reference genomes that we clustered into species groups. These
    cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but
    only a small proportion of microbes in other environments,
    including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes
    from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used
    rare SNPs to track strains between hosts. Using this approach, we
    found that although species compositions of mothers and infants
    converged over time, strain-level similarity diverged.
    Specifically, early colonizing bacteria were often transmitted
    from an infant's mother, while late colonizing bacteria were often
    transmitted from other sources in the environment and were
    enriched for spore-formation genes. We also applied MIDAS to 198
    globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to
    show that many prevalent bacterial species have population
    structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level
    genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive
    structure and dynamics that are obscured when data are analyzed at

  abstract     = {Background: Certain protein families are highly
    conserved across distantly related organisms and belong to large
    and functionally diverse superfamilies. The patterns of
    conservation present in these protein sequences presumably are due
    to selective constraints maintaining important but unknown
    structural mechanisms with some constraints specific to each
    family and others shared by a larger subset or by the entire
    superfamily. To exploit these patterns as a source of functional
    information, we recently devised a statistically based approach
    called contrast hierarchical alignment and interaction network
    (CHAIN) analysis, which infers the strengths of various categories
    of selective constraints from co-conserved patterns in a multiple
    alignment. The power of this approach strongly depends on the
    quality of the multiple alignments, which thus motivated
    development of theoretical concepts and strategies to improve
    alignment of conserved motifs within large sets of distantly
    related sequences. Results: Here we describe a hidden Markov model
    (HMM), an algebraic system, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    sampling strategies for alignment of multiple sequence motifs. The
    MCMC sampling strategies are useful both for alignment
    optimization and for adjusting position specific background amino
    acid frequencies for alignment uncertainties. Associated
    statistical formulations provide an objective measure of alignment
    quality as well as automatic gap penalty optimization. Improved
    alignments obtained in this way are compared with PSI-BLAST based
    alignments within the context of CHAIN analysis of three protein
    families: Gi{$\alpha$} subunits, prolyl oligopeptidases, and
    transitional endoplasmic reticulum (p97) AAA+ ATPases. Conclusion:
    While not entirely replacing PSI-BLAST based alignments, which
    likewise may be optimized for CHAIN analysis using this approach,
    these motif-based methods often more accurately align very
    distantly related sequences and thus can provide a better measure
    of selective constraints. In some instances, these new approaches
    also provide a better understanding of familyspecific constraints,
    as we illustrate for p97 ATPases. Programs implementing these
    procedures and supplementary information are available from the

  abstract     = {Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently
    used in medicine to treat recurrent clostridial colitis and other
    intestinal diseases. However, neither the therapeutic mechanism of
    FMT nor the mechanism that allows the donor bacteria to colonize
    the intestine of the recipient has yet been clearly described.
    From a biological point of view, FMT can be considered a useful
    model for studying the ecology of host-associated microbial
    communities. FMT experiments can shed light on the relationship
    features between the host and its gut microbiota. This creates the
    need for experimentation with approaches to metagenomic data
    analysis which may be useful for the interpretation of observed
    biological phenomena. Here, the recipient intestine colonization
    analysis tool (RECAST) novel computational approach is presented,
    which is based on the metagenomic read sorting process per their
    origin in the recipient's post-FMT stool metagenome. Using the
    RECAST algorithm, taxonomic/functional annotation, and machine
    learning approaches, the metagenomes from three FMT studies,
    including healthy volunteers, patients with clostridial colitis,
    and patients with metabolic syndrome, were analyzed. Using our
    computational pipeline, the donor-derived and recipient-derived
    microbes which formed the recipient post-FMT stool metagenomes
    (successful microbes) were identified. Their presence is well
    explained by a higher relative abundance in donor/pre-FMT
    recipient metagenomes or other metagenomes from the human
    population. In addition, successful microbes are enriched with
    gene groups potentially related to antibiotic resistance,
    including antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, the observed

    Bacteroides fragilis 638R, originally isolated in the USA, was
    made with two previously sequenced strains isolated in the UK
    (NCTC 9343) and Japan (YCH46). The presence of 10 loci containing
    genes associated with polysaccharide (PS) biosynthesis, each
    including a putative Wzx flippase and Wzy polymerase, was
    confirmed in all three strains, despite a lack of cross-reactivity
    between NCTC 9343 and 638R surface PS-specific antibodies by
    immunolabelling and microscopy. Genomic comparisons revealed an
    exceptional level of PS biosynthesis locus diversity. Of the 10
    divergent PS-associated loci apparent in each strain, none is
    similar between NCTC 9343 and 638R. YCH46 shares one locus with
    NCTC 9343, confirmed by mAb labelling, and a second different
    locus with 638R, making a total of 28 divergent PS biosynthesis
    loci amongst the three strains. The lack of expression of the
    phase-variable large capsule (LC) in strain 638R, observed in NCTC
    9343, is likely to be due to a point mutation that generates a
    stop codon within a putative initiating glycosyltransferase,
    necessary for the expression of the LC in NCTC 9343. Other major
    sequence differences were observed to arise from different numbers
    and variety of inserted extra-chromosomal elements, in particular
    prophages. Extensive horizontal gene transfer has occurred within
    these strains, despite the presence of a significant number of
    divergent DNA restriction and modification systems that act to
    prevent acquisition of foreign DNA. The level of amongst-strain
    diversity in PS biosynthesis loci is unprecedented.,},

    donor to patient is a treatment for microbiome-associated
    diseases. Although the success of FMT requires donor bacteria to

    the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, to
    uncover the rules of engraftment in humans. We built a statistical
    model that predicts which bacterial species will engraft in a
    given host, and developed Strain Finder, a method to infer strain
    genotypes and track them over time. We find that engraftment can
    be predicted largely from the abundance and phylogeny of bacteria
    in the donor and the pre-FMT patient. Furthermore, donor strains
    within a species engraft in an all-or-nothing manner and
    previously undetected strains frequently colonize patients
    receiving FMT. We validated these findings for metabolic syndrome,
    suggesting that the same principles of engraftment extend to other
    indications. Smillie et al. profile the gut microbiota of
    recurrent Clostridium difficile patients during fecal microbiota
    transplantation (FMT) and uncover the principles of microbiota
    engraftment in humans. They validate their findings across several
    FMT datasets and in another disease context, metabolic syndrome.},

    is. Here ( clinicaltrails.gov : NCT03006809 ) we have tested the
    effects of antibiotic pretreatment and compared two modes of
    maintenance dose delivery, capsules versus enema, in a randomized,
    pilot, open-label, 2\texttimes 2 factorial design with 22 patients
    analyzed with mild to moderate UC. Clinically, the treatment was
    well-tolerated with favorable safety profile. Of patients who
    received antibiotic pretreatment, 6 of 11 experienced remission
    after six weeks of treatment, versus 2 of 11 non-pretreated
    patients (odds ratio: 1.69, 95\% confidence interval: -0.25 to
    3.62). No significant differences were found between maintenance
    dosing via capsules versus enema. In exploratory analyses,
    microbiome turnover at both the species and strain levels was
    extensive and significantly more pronounced in the pretreated
    patients. Associations were also revealed between taxonomic
    turnover and changes in the composition of primary and secondary
    bile acids. Together these findings suggest that antibiotic
    pretreatment contributes to microbiome engraftment and possibly
    clinical effectiveness, and validate longitudinal strain tracking
    as a powerful way to monitor the dynamics and impact of microbiota

    conventional metagenome assemblies on individual strain genomes.
    We show that Strainberry is also able to refine microbial

    ecology is essential to engineer effective microbial therapeutics
    and to model microbial community assembly and succession in health
    and disease. However, establishing generalizable insights into the
    functional determinants of microbial fitness in the human gut has
    been a formidable challenge. Here we employ fecal microbiota
    transplantation (FMT) as an in natura experimental model to
    identify determinants of microbial colonization and resilience.
    Our long-term sampling strategy and high-resolution multi-omics
    analyses of FMT donors and recipients reveal adaptive ecological
    processes as the main driver of microbial colonization outcomes
    after FMT. We also show that high-fitness donor microbial
    populations are significantly enriched in metabolic pathways that
    are responsible for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, essential
    amino acids, and micronutrients, independent of taxonomy. To
    determine whether such metabolic competence can explain the
    microbial ecology of human disease states, we analyzed genomes
    reconstructed from healthy humans and humans with inflammatory
    bowel disease (IBD). Our data reveal that such traits are also
    significantly enriched in microbial genomes recovered from IBD
    patients, linking presence of superior metabolic competence in
    bacteria to their expansion in IBD. Overall, these findings
    suggest that the transfer of gut microbes from a healthy donor to
    a disrupted recipient environment initiates an environmental
    filter that selects for populations that can self-sustain. Such
    ecological processes that select for self-sustenance under stress
    offer a model to explain why common yet typically rare members of
    healthy gut environments can become dominant in inflammatory
    conditions without any need for them to be causally associated

    as 1\texttimes. On real samples, the pipeline showed higher
    sensitivity than assembly-based approaches and it proved
    successful in identifying strains in epidemic outbreaks as well as
    in intestinal, skin and gastrointestinal microbiome samples.},

  abstract     = {DNA barcoding through the use of amplified regions
    of the ribosomal operon, such as the 16S gene, is a routine method
    to gain an overview of the microbial taxonomic diversity within a
    sample without the need to isolate and culture the microbes
    present. However, bacterial cells usually have multiple copies of
    this ribosomal operon, and choosing the `wrong' copy could provide
    a misleading species classification. While this presents less of a
    problem for well-characterized organisms with large sequence
    databases to interrogate, it is a significant challenge for lesser
    known organisms with unknown copy number and diversity. Using the
    entire length of the ribosomal operon, which encompasses the 16S,
    23S, 5S and internal transcribed spacer regions, should provide
    greater taxonomic resolution but has not been well explored. Here,
    we use publicly available reference genomes and explore the
    theoretical boundaries when using concatenated genes and the
    full-length ribosomal operons, which has been made possible by the
    development and uptake of long-read sequencing technologies. We
    quantify the issues of both copy choice and operon length in a
    phylogenetic context to demonstrate that longer regions improve
    the phylogenetic signal while maintaining taxonomic accuracy.},
